# Pokemon_Battle_Simulator
This is an attempt to create a Pokemon battle simulator. The intent is to emulate Pokemon battles using Python.
I want to create this as same as possible to the original game. 
The emulation is based on the 8th generation of Pokemon. If the 9th one gets released, I will try to emulate it as well.
